    <h1>Cities I Have Lived In</h1>
    <p>I grew up in the Bedford area for most of my life. 
        After Highschool, I moved around and found myself 
        in Hawkins before joing the military and ending up in Fayetteville.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fayetteville</li>
        <li>Hawkins</li>
        <li>Bedford</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Cities I Want To Visit</h1>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Dublin</strong></li> 
            <p><span>I have been to Dublin once before but I would like to return as an adult.</span></p>
        <li><em>Tokyo</em></li> 
            <p><span>Tokyo has been on my list since I was a little kid. I have always been facinated
                with the culture in Japan.</span></p> 
        <li><strong>Zagreb</strong></li>
            <p><span>Zagreb is where my Step-Mom is from and I would love to see her homeland.</span></p>
